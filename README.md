# Systems-Biology
The "EMT Ternary Switch Model" folder contains the Python script for my research project for my Practical Systems Biology module at the University of Edinburgh, tasked with reproducing a model and creating a hypothesis about the model. An Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) model by Jia et al. (https://doi.org/10.1186/s41236-017-0005-8) was recreated. Missing parameters were optimised using a genetic algorithm.
The remaining two folders containing other assignments for this module involving exercises on entropy, genetic switches and oscillations.
