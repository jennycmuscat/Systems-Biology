# Systems-Biology
The "EMT Ternary Switch Model" folder contains the Python script for my research project for my Practical Systems Biology module at the University of Edinburgh, tasked with reproducing a model and creating a hypothesis about the model. Missing parameters were optimised using a genetic algorithm.
The remaining two folders containing other assignments for this module involving exercises on entropy, genetic switches and oscillations.

I am also currently working on a research project where I am re-creating a published model program on Python and testing a novel hypothesis using this model.
